# GeekForGeeks-Projects
This repository contains (modified) C programming projects on the GeekForGeeks website, solved in a more understandable, simpler way. Find the project descriptions here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-projects/
The first 14 projects are for beginners in C programming, the next 5 are intermediate projects, and the remaining 6 are advanced level C projects.
This repository is a work in progress, and thus does not contain all the solutions to the projects currently. Commits would be made by the author regularly to update the solutions to the projects as described on the GeekforGeeks webpage referenced above.
Feel free to contribute to any of the projects, and copy the codes as you need.
